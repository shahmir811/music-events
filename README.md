## Usage

### Setup Backend

Used [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for backened as it is the next-gen headless CMS, open-source, javascript, enabling content-rich experiences to be created, managed and exposed to any digital device. Also for image upload, I used the [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

### Run the Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
